### System Architecture

The game follows a **modular system architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```
Game Engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Power Network System     (Core unique mechanic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Building System         (Construction & management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Enemy AI System         (Opponent behaviors)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Wave System            (Challenge progression)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Combat System          (Damage & interactions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Resource System        (Economy & progression)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UI System             (Player interface)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Rendering System      (Visuals & effects)
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules create complex strategic situations
2. **Network Dependencies**: Power connections create infrastructure vulnerabilities
3. **Resource Management**: Multiple currencies (minerals, energy, power) create trade-offs
4. **Escalating Challenge**: Exponential difficulty growth maintains engagement
5. **Player Agency**: Multiple valid strategies and tactical decisions

### Critical Algorithms

#### Power Network Analysis (BFS)
```python
def update_power_network():
    # Breadth-first search to find connected building clusters
    # Each cluster becomes an isolated power block
    # Power generation/consumption calculated per block
```

#### Wave Difficulty Scaling
```python
def calculate_wave_points(wave_number):
    return 10 * (1.6 ** wave_number)  # Exponential growth
```

#### Building Connection Logic
```python
def auto_connect_buildings(new_building):
    # Find buildings within 170 pixel range
    # Prioritize connectors, then power sources
    # Respect connection limits per building type
```

## üìä Configuration System
